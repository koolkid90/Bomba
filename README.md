# Bomba
BOMBA is a next-generation cryptographic system based on the principle of floating entropy. Unlike classical ciphers (AES, ChaCha20) where entropy is fixed (256 bits), BOMBA increases entropy linearly with message length.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Architecture

The system is built on four levels:
Level	Component	Purpose
0	Super-Master SEED	Root key (any length string)
1	Platinum SEED (256 bits)	Two-factor transformation
2	Global Base (65k symbols)	Deterministic byte-to-symbol mapping
3	Z measurements (5-26)	Polymorphic encoding

Key advantage: Due to Z measurements, each byte can be represented by one of Z different symbols, making differential and linear cryptanalysis practically impossible.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Core Transformations

XOR Transformation

Purpose: Ensures ciphertext depends on every key bit. Without XOR, known-plaintext attacks would be trivial.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two-Factor Protection

Platinum SEED = (Super-Master + Human Key)

    Factor 1: Super-Master SEED (can be stored)

    Factor 2: Human Key (entered each time)

Even if one factor is compromised, the other remains secret.

======================================================================================

Mathematical Proof ( by AI )

Entropy Formula:
math

S = H_{key} + L \times (M + \log_2(Z) \times B)

Where:

    H_{key} — Platinum SEED entropy (256 bits)

    L — message length

    M — mask bits (24 bits)

    Z — number of measurements

P. S. (Post Scriptum)

Hello! The original idea of this cipher is mine, but I wrote it using vibe coding (coding with AI assistance). I've been studying cryptography for less than six months, but as far as I can tell — the encryption works.

I will be glad to receive tests and attacks on it, as well as modifications and improvements from the community.

This is an open invitation:

    Try to break it

    Suggest improvements

    Port it to other languages (Rust, C, Go, Python)
